The original test cases have been written by Remo for his master thesis.
They have been extended for later work (FOSD'16, VaMoS'17) to avoid overly large MSCs with more than four components. Thus, large MSCs have been split into smaller ones. This also increased the number of MSCs to 93.

Using Sabrina's grammar, they can be automatically compiled into a LaTeX file which computes a tikz figure for the MSC.
